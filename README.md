# NeptuPy
Personal repo for analysis of Voyager's Neptune asociated data.
# Mission
## 1. Main
Provide a way to build an **amateur** scientist community around Neptune planet focused in <u>play with data</u> from Voyager 2 (and others sources)
## 2. Specific objectives
TODO

# Tools
## 1. Python Utilities
### 1.1 AstroPy
The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a core package for astronomy using the Python programming language and improve usability, interoperability, and collaboration between astronomy Python packages. The core astropy package contains functionality aimed at professional astronomers and astrophysicists, but may be useful to anyone developing astronomy software. The Astropy Project also includes "affiliated packages," Python packages that are not necessarily developed by the core development team, but share the goals of Astropy, and often build from the core package's code and infrastructure. [Info](http://www.astropy.org/)
### 1.2 PhotUtils
Photutils is an affiliated package of Astropy to provide tools for detecting and performing photometry of astronomical sources. It is an open source (BSD licensed) Python package. [Info](http://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
### 1.3 SpiceyPy
SpiceyPy is a python wrapper for the SPICE Toolkit. SPICE is an essential tool for scientists and engineers alike in the planetary science field for Solar System Geometry. [Info](http://spiceypy.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## 2. ISIS (USGS)
 The Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) is a free, specialized, digital image processing software package developed by the USGS for NASA. ISIS key feature is the ability to place many types of data in the correct cartographic location, enabling disparate data to be co-analyzed. ISIS also includes standard image processing applications such as contrast, stretch, image algebra, filters, and statistical analysis. ISIS can process two-dimensional images as well as three-dimensional cubes derived from imaging spectrometers. The production of USGS topographic maps of extraterrestrial landing sites relies on ISIS software. ISIS is able to process data from NASA and International spacecraft missions including Lunar Orbiter, Apollo, Voyager, Mariner 10, Viking, Galileo, Magellan, Clementine, Mars Global Surveyor, Cassini, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MESSENGER, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Chandrayaan, Dawn, Kaguya, and New Horizons.

## 3. SAO DS9
SAOImage DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application. DS9 supports FITS images and binary tables, multiple frame buffers, region manipulation, and many scale algorithms and colormaps. It provides for easy communication with external analysis tasks and is highly configurable and extensible via XPA and SAMP.

## 4. SPICE Toolkit
SPICE, an ancillary information system that provides scientists and engineers the capability to include space geometry and event data into mission design, science observation planning, and science data analysis software.

The principle components of the SPICE system are SPICE Toolkit software and SPICE data filesâ€”often called "kernels."

SPICE is used throughout NASA and within many other U.S. and international agencies for organizing, distributing, and accessing ancillary data associated with space science missions. The NAIF website contains the few important rules regarding using SPICE. Please take a moment to read these.
