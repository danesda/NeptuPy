This file reports any known errors and describes known deviations from PDS
standards.

(1) Formats of PDS *_NAME keyword values

PDS standards require that *_NAME keywords use blanks rather than underscores
to represent spaces between words, e.g.,
    COLUMN_NAME = "SAMPLE NUMBER"
not
    COLUMN_NAME = "SAMPLE_NUMBER"

In this data set, the values for NAMEs on columns have used the latter
underscore notation. This provides greater compatibility with prior data sets.

(2) Missing ASCII text version of one document

The Voyager ISS calibration report is provided on this volume in Adobe
Acrobat format as:
    DOCUMENT/REPORT/BENESH_JEPSEN_1978.PDF

PDS standards require an ASCII (or simple HTML) version of every document.
Because this report was generated by scanning a paper document, and optical
character recognition software was found to be unreliable, no ASCII equivalent
of this document is available. To generate an ASCII version would entail
re-typing the entire document.

(3) Removed files

We found that image C0902619 was an incomplete version of C0902618. To avoid
confusion, C0902619 has been removed from the archive. Please refer to the
earlier image.

Image C1064447.IMQ, from the original PDS volume of compressed raw images, has
a corrupted header and could not be processed. It has been deleted from this
data set.

(4) Erroneous edit mode

About 700 images were found to have a edit mode of 0:0 in the original index.
We attempted to fill in the the correct values. Many of them appeared to use
the full field of view and were therefore assigned an edit mode of 1:1. We
also used 1:3 or 1:32 for some of these images, in each case describing the
approximate fraction of the 800x800 pixel grid that contains data. These are
approximate values. We have noted any changes to the edit mode of the images
in the INDEX/INDEX.TAB files.

(5) Unknown Exposure Durations

The following images can be identified as relatively long exposures based on
the presence of long star trails. However, the both the headers of these
images and the original index files identify the exposure duration as 5 msec.
Because we do not know the correct exposure durations, we have calibrated
these images as if they were 5 msec exposures. Relative brightness variations
within the images should be reliable, but the absolute calibration is likely
to be incorrect.

(6) Target mis-identifications and note fields

The TARGET_NAME and NOTE fields in the index files contain what is at best a
reconstruction of the intended purpose of each image obtained during the
Voyager flybys. This information has been copied from the original CD-ROM
volumes, and has not been updated by the Rings Node. These fields may contain
useful information for searches, but should not be regarded as 100% reliable.
Note, for example, that multiple targets often fall within the same Voyager
image, and that images from the same sequence often served multiple science
goals.

OPUS, the on-line search tool at the PDS Rings Node, should provide more
reliable search capabilities. Please bring mis-identifications to the
attention of the Rings Node so that we can update the OPUS database. We do not
plan to publish updates to the index files included on these volumes.
